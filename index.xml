      <title>Uber Data Modeling Project</title>
      <link>https://ilanreinstein.github.io/project/uber-data-modeling-project/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ilanreinstein.github.io/project/uber-data-modeling-project/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is another project that I recently added to my learning portfolio. Thanks to Darshil Parmar&amp;rsquo;s video for the inspiration and the skeleton to get this project up and running. For anyone interested in seeing Data Engineering projects in action, please follow Darshil for more content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-the-project-is-about&#34;&gt;What the project is about?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project consists in using a data sample of Uber rides to create a very simple star schema to do analytics on. Darshil breaks down each of the tasks very well so it is pretty easy to follow. In addition to showing how to build each of the data model&amp;rsquo;s components, he goes on to show how to setup a basic infrastructure on Google Cloud. For orchestration he uses Mage, which I had heard about but since I was first introduced to Airflow, I never dedicated much attention to it. I have to say, I really enjoyed working on it. At least for an &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; task such as the one worked in the toy project, I got to see the potential of such tool and how nice it is to build pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-learned&#34;&gt;What I learned?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-modeling&#34;&gt;Data Modeling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data model Darshil presents is very simple yet useful as a toy example for entry-level engineers like myself. I also did some modifications to the model given the way Polars handles the joins as opposed to Pandas, and also because I tried really hard to understand each step of the way in creating the Facts and Dimensions. For example, Darshil uses a main  key in the original table which he then uses to join with all dimensions. This seemed to work in Pandas because of the keys in both tables are preserved after the join, somthing that does not happen in Polars. Therefore, I had to revisit previous bootcamp projects to understand how to perform the final join that produces the Fact Table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I understood correctly, I created surrogate keys for each dimension table and then I joined the resulting fact table not on these keys, but on the data fields. E.g., for Payment Type Code Dimension, I created the &lt;code&gt;payment_type_id&lt;/code&gt; variable for each unique row, and then I combined with the Fact table using the actual &lt;code&gt;payment_type_name&lt;/code&gt;, which is the only resulting column common to both Fact and Dim in this case. Again, not sure if this is the right way, but based on the way Polars handles the joins, I was left with this approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, I had to eliminate Location Dimensions (Lat and Long) since I would have been joining on floats. These are the main differences with what Darshil presented. I was a bit confused for a moment, but I relied on previous projects to make some progress in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tools&#34;&gt;Tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to interact with a few new tools which I had never used before like Mage. It was pretty straightforward to deploy and setup the UI, plus it takes care of adding some simple tests to your code, which is nice and instructional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to add a twist to the whole project and take Polars for a test drive. This is a newer data manipulation package in Python which has been gaining popularity and traction among my LinkedIn connections, that is why I decided to try it out. It has very similar feel to PySpark, something I really enjoyed over the few hours I spent building the ETL. I can see why people are moving away from Pandas and going to Polars, it is way faster. I did not do any proper benchmark with big size data or any comparison in performance but it is cool to see a library performing that well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was already familiar with GCP, but as everything in life, repetition and practice are key. Seeing another example at play and understanding what each component means was a great learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-up&#34;&gt;Next up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting these foundations for more complex projects is highly rewarding. It is only up to now that I found some bandwidth to sit down and try to be consistent with my journey to become a better data engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like taking baby steps in the learning process, I find that doing this early on compounds quicker to larger projects and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will now move this exact same pipeline to AWS, and instead of Mage I will revisit Airflow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Journey in Data Science...</title>
      <link>https://ilanreinstein.github.io/post/my-journey-in-data-science/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ilanreinstein.github.io/post/my-journey-in-data-science/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, I have given multiple talks and participated in forums discussing my professional trajectory and my experience as a data scientist. In this post I will try to compile my path and give a few tips into how I think one may break into data science and analytics. This is not a novel guide, nor a comprehensive path to break into data science, but I think I&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed to enough to share my story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;from-physics-to-data-science&#34;&gt;From physics to Data Science&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started my undergraduate degree in physics, I knew I always wanted to do hands-on problem solving. I was undecided on which branch of engineering I should choose to fulfill my career expectations. I thought physics would give enough technical abilities and a broad exposure to science and math to eventually drift towards a more clear path into problem solving in the real world. I was surprised and wrong with how things turned out..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my third and last year of college, I was already fantasizing going into grad school to pursue a PhD in some wacky quantum-focused specialty and problem. This process led me to a lot of frustration: exam preparations, applications, finding schools and potential advisors, you name it. I started to get the feeling this pathway was not very natural to my abilities and my aspirations, I felt like forcing me to do something I was not and that brought me a lot of pain as I felt increasingly under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, after a few rejections I stopped to rethink my decisions, and I thought that maybe finding a job would be a more fulfilling approach to start growing and learning new skills. I started contacting my professors, applying to jobs, and connecting with people. To my surprise, just after a few weeks after graduating, I already had multiple interviews in different sectors. This process slowly but surely presented me with opportunities and potential paths to follow in my career as a problem solver. Over the multiple interviews, I heard words like Big Data, Data Science, Machine Learning, etc. I was thrilled. I thought this was an interesting opening worth diving into and it was then in 2014 when I managed to &amp;lsquo;break into data science&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NoteSense: Automated Assessment of Clinical Documentation</title>
      <link>https://ilanreinstein.github.io/publication/notesense-clinical-documentation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Residents receive infrequent feedback on their clinical reasoning (CR) documentation. While machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) have been used to assess CR documentation in standardized cases, no studies have described similar use in the clinical environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors developed and validated using Kane’s framework a ML model for automated assessment of CR documentation quality in residents’ admission notes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Residency programs face overwhelming numbers of residency applications, limiting holistic review. Artificial intelligence techniques have been proposed to address this challenge but have not been created. Here, a multidisciplinary team sought to develop and validate a machine learning (ML)-based decision support tool (DST) for residency applicant screening and review.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learning Curves and Multilevel Models</title>
      <link>https://ilanreinstein.github.io/publication/learning-curves-multilevel-models/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ilanreinstein.github.io/publication/learning-curves-multilevel-models/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is one of the projects I am most proud of. It was a tremendously hard journey, with lots of obstacles, both technical and conceptual, which lead to a constant reformulation of our initial problem. Despite all the difficulties, we managed to build a relatively simple model which is to be tested on further studies and prototypes about learning curves. This is the project that got me started with Hierarchical Models and Bayesian Statistics. Even though we did not develop a full Bayesian model for this occasion, I was constantly learning new things about regression and multilevel models, which naturally takes you into the Bayesian world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the privilege to collaborate with experts in the field like Martin Pusic, Jennifer Hill, David Cook, and Matthew Lineberry, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in education, adaptive learning algorithms and the potential applications of multilevel models in this type of setting, then I&amp;rsquo;m sure this paper will be quite enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do not hesitate to reach out with an questions you may have about this, I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to discuss more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As one of many of NYU Langone&amp;rsquo;s data scientists, I got to collaborate with the wonderful team from the Predictive Analytics Unit from NYU&amp;rsquo;s Medical Center to develop a model capable of predicting which patients will have favorable outcomes after being hospitalized. These were intense weeks not only at NYU and I am proud of being able to contribute to this project and help our physicians during these challenging times.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Resources to Learn Bayesian Stats</title>
      <link>https://ilanreinstein.github.io/post/bayesian_resources/resources-to-learn-bayesian-stats/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ilanreinstein.github.io/post/bayesian_resources/resources-to-learn-bayesian-stats/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I summarize a series of resources to get started with Bayesian Statistics. I compiled these references myself based on my own experience and opinion as to what a good introduction and next steps are in this process. This is not an academic curriculum or anything tremendously rigorous, but it is a comprehensive list that will surely get you embarked on the journey to revisiting/starting your statistics. Many of the references below were recommended to me in several workshops I&amp;rsquo;ve attended and I wanted to share with those like me that want to be better at statistics and Machine Learning (ML).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first resource I can think of out there for beginners interested in Bayesian statistics and modeling is Richard McElreath’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Statistical Rethinking&lt;/a&gt;. Here you’ll learn everything from applying Bayes’ rule in simple problems to complex multilevel/hierarchical models. Since this is not only a book but also a full course, you should definitely follow along your reading with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdNM4Edgs7weiyIguLSToZRI&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;video lectures on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. I would encourage you to work through the code and exercises at the end of each chapter, it is the best way to start getting hands on expertise in this topic. Another great thing is that the book’s R package &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rethinking&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and all the example code has been translated into multiple programming languages, so you are free to choose the one of your preference to go through the reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A powerful reference for those that feel like brushing up your stats with real-world examples, Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastic book for those with more interest on Applied Statistics on a social science setting. An updated version of this book is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Regression and Other Stories&lt;/a&gt; (Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, Aki Vehtari) and it will be released later this year. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to work through another more advanced course on Bayesian Statistics, I suggest you visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Aki Vehtari’s teaching page&lt;/a&gt;. Although more challenging than McElreath&amp;rsquo;s class it is worth checking it out. Again, the course material is available in R and Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you’ve refreshed your basic stats and gone through most of McElreath’s book, but you are also looking into ML. You may wonder, where should I go? What to do next? Challenge yourself to read Christopher Bishop’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt;. Bishop’s book presents all the well known ML concepts from regression and classification to neural networks through a concealed Bayesian lens. It is fair to say that I&amp;rsquo;ve deeply strengthen my knowledge in both ML and Bayesian statistics just by working through the first chapters. Although I highly recommend it, keep in mind this is an advanced book and it takes some time to get your head around the concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same level as Bishop’s book, you can also find a rigorous and detailed explanation of Bayesian statistics and modeling on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/itila/book.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;David MacKay’s Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms&lt;/a&gt;. I was fortunate enough to use this book in college, and it still proves to be essential whenever I want to revisit some probability concepts, Bayesian statistics and ML. The book&amp;rsquo;s webpage also provides software resources and examples for you to experiment and play around as you navigate the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you feel comfortable enough with the basics to go deeper into the math and the theoretical concepts behind probabilistic modeling, probabilistic computation and applied Bayesian Statistics I strongly encourage you to read &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://betanalpha.github.io/writing/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Michael Betancourt’s case studies&lt;/a&gt; in due order. This will be challenging to grasp at first, but as you go back over the content and dedicate the time to understand these concepts, the reward is huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not very often that you hear about the success stories of Bayesian methods in industry, specially nowadays against the huge amount of attention on ML and AI. For those that like podcasts to listen to stories about practitioners and people applying Bayesian statistics to their fields I strongly advise that you check out Alexandre Andorra&amp;rsquo;s podcast Learning Bayesian Statistics. Alex does an amazing job at interviewing professionals from a wide variety of fields, with incredibly diverse backgrounds and experiences, hence introducing you to the vast universe of applications of Bayesian statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final thing that it is a hard requirement and a common thread between the references and resources listed above is Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In order to fully explore probability spaces and distributions you need efficient and reliable computational methods like MCMC and its advanced variants. Today, many programming languages are capable of implementing such advanced estimation algorithm but the most popular are 1) &lt;a href=&#34;https://mc-stan.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Stan&lt;/a&gt;, which is built on C++ and has multiple interfaces to R (&lt;a href=&#34;http://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;rstanarm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;brms&lt;/a&gt;), Python (&lt;a href=&#34;https://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;PyStan&lt;/a&gt;), Julia and others; and 2) &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.pymc.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;PyMC3&lt;/a&gt;. If you are interested in learning the basics you may visit their webpages to see examples with code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some personal remarks on my own journey through Bayesian Statistics. This topic is not easy, you should invest some time to see some progress. The references above are a great starting point and I’ve noticed an important step forward in my learning path by trying to apply Bayesian methods to my own work. For me, its fundamentals are more intuitive and transparent, and overall simpler to grasp (at least conceptually), but considerably harder to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of my journey in Statistics and Machine Learning, I was fortunate enough to write original content about popular libraries, algorithms and software packages used in this line of work. This content was all developed during the time I worked with KDnuggets, a site that is widely recognized for its contributions on content about recent advances in the field of Big Data and Predictive Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may visit the site and my contributions on this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kdnuggets.com/author/ilan-reinstein&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of a consultancy project I did for the Interamerican Development Bank (IADB), I worked closely with the Energy and  Oil &amp;amp; Gas division to develop a series of interactive tools that would allow them to summarize their data in a friendly way , and so that this information may be shared internally with other departments and externally with stakeholders, i.e., countries and governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data used for this project was provided internally by the bank, as well as gathered from different sources like BP&amp;rsquo;s Annual Energy Report, OECD data, World Bank data, and OPEC data among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual product consists in a series of interactive maps developed in D3, and it is hosted inside the bank, therefore data and code may not be shared. However, an overview of the project may be observed in the following pictures.I hope you like my visualization work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Six Degress of Data Turbulence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally, I have made some time to begin adding some interesting content to this blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a few minutes to gather some of the music I&amp;rsquo;ve heard lately, and decide which one has been the most &lt;strong&gt;resonant&lt;/strong&gt; with my daily mood. If you don&amp;rsquo;t like heavy metal, progressive music, or psychedelic rock, then maybe this site is not for you. If you do like it, then I will try to come up with great suggestions for you to listen during those times of tremendous focus. I am one of those people that needs to listen to some tunes in order to work faster and better, otherwise my routine will be dull, unexciting, and even worst, a field trip to my attention span. If sometimes you feel the same way, welcome to &lt;strong&gt;Resonance,&lt;/strong&gt; where the musical recommendations are intended to resonate with your working day, in particular, while performing Data Science related tasks like data cleaning, testing, scripting, plotting, Kaggling, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also hope this blog helps you and I explore new music for Data Science. I clearly intend to hear suggestions from others and apply them to whatever working mood I feel on a given day: your thoughts and ideas are welcome here. So, without further ado, here is the first entry of this blog. Please enjoy, rock on, and keep working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I&amp;rsquo;ve been collecting information about Data Science and Analytics graduate programs around Europe. It has been a very mechanic, almost automatic activity, so I thought something structured, powerful, and continuous was necessary. That is why I tuned into Dream Theater, specifically, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. This album is from the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s and it is divided into two. I&amp;rsquo;ve had this album on my library for years now, but it was only until about a couple of weeks that I listened to it carefully while cruising the web and writing some code. I was blown away by the amount of work I managed to complete for the duration of the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept playing it for next days while working and I was amazed by how much energy the album can transmit. The highly structured rhythm patterns and complex compositions are just amazing, as well as the diversity and variety of the songs, just enough variability to keep you interested and focused at the same time. One particular aspect of the album, which I think contributes enormously to my productivity, is the longevity and continuity of every song: a not uncommon feature in the band&amp;rsquo;s writing and playing style. The fact that you don&amp;rsquo;t notice when a song ends and the other begins is a key factor to stay focused as you hardly keep track of how much time has passed. That feeling, I believe is key when finding the right piece to sit down and get things done, an overwhelming sense of non-advancing, infinite time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to Portnoy&amp;rsquo;s double kick for hours is the best medicine for restlessness and constant distractions. If you manage to keep up with with his pace, you will most definitely maintain full concentration for long period of time, even at late-night hours. When is not the drums, someone else is going to be hitting those 16th notes at high speeds, and that for me is uplifting and motivating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you begin the album, you are greeted by The Glass Prison, an absolute 14-minute masterpiece, enough to get your to-do lists done at a nice rhythm. Then comes Blind Faith, usually this is the one that I need to listen to with full attention, I just enjoy that song too much. You will continue through this first part with great stamina and focus, and then&amp;hellip; Overture. A majestic instrumental piece which opens up the gates to what I think is the more conceptual part of the album, and from there on, the album has already absorbed you into its full depth. An interesting fact, if you listen to Dream Theater&amp;rsquo;s albums carefully, and in alphabetical order, for example, Scenes From a Memory -&amp;gt; Six Degrees, you will see that they are perfectly connected so you could listen to them for an entire day! However, we will not dive into that today so let&amp;rsquo;s return to our idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I&amp;rsquo;ve finished the album, I have already crossed out more than half of my daily tasks and it&amp;rsquo;s not even lunch time. This album not just gives me push and stamina, but it is also loud and powerful enough to keep me focused and calm. On stressful days, listening to something heavy is always good, you don&amp;rsquo;t hear the noise of unnecessary worries and problems in your head, you manage to just keep moving and finish everything properly without being so restless. Needless to say, it&amp;rsquo;s Dream Theater we are talking about, so I had to stop every now and then to grasp and enjoy the epic guitar solos and the long, loud, and melancholic finales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you listen and enjoy this incredibly epic, conceptual, fast-paced album. In a future post, I will write more about Dream Theater as it is my go-to band during working hours. They have tons of material, highly suited to do data science, so I will be circling back to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rock n&#39; roll&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ilanreinstein.github.io/post/data-stories/my-first-data-stories/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is simply to display and promote some of my early projects in analytics and data visualization. The topics are diverse, ranging from sports to energy economics. These are simply some exploratory and visual analyses I performed in 2014 when trying to promote our product. The purpose of these posts was to educate businesses on the potential of data-driven decisions as well as showcase and expose our data products and solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very fond of these small projects as it was my first experience using R and performing data analytics and visualization, thus encouraging me to pursue a career in data science. I hope you enjoy the read and the insight. I will try to produce newer posts in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow this link to see the full &lt;a href=&#34;http://rpubs.com/ireinstein&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Portfolio&lt;/a&gt; with both the code and the data story.&lt;/p&gt;
